# Project 2

## Outside resources
*I used the [Skeleton CSS framework](http://getskeleton.com/), a lightweight alternative to Bootstrap. I began with the default template and adjusted the margins and background color in an external CSS document. I consulted [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for various CSS tips, including text alignment, font weight, and colors. For the body surface formula idea, I consulted and reviewed these two generic BSA calculator websites: [https://www.calculator.net/body-surface-area-calculator.html](https://www.calculator.net/body-surface-area-calculator.html) and [http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bsa-calculator/](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bsa-calculator/). I also consulted stackoverflow(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6535362/gitignore-after-commit) to deal with a problem I had removing the .idea directory from the git repo.*

## Notes for instructor
*I used the Form class as my usage of classes. I thought about making a class for the BSA calculations, but considered it unnecessary. I based my error presentation code on the code used in lecture. I also noticed that PHPStorm was formatting the HTML code differently than standard web beautifiers like [this](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html), which I tried when I noticed than <div> tags weren't indenting as expected with Cntrl-Alt-L. However, even after I did this, PHPStorm changed the indentation again.*
